# [StrOng](https://strong-volunter.vercel.app/home) - FrontEnd

## Overview

Application developed as part of an academic project. I was responsible for developing the application code, both the frontend and the [backend](https://github.com/SamuelMenecucci/strong-api).
The application was targeted towards NGOs seeking volunteers for technology-related tasks, with the aim of creating a platform where organizations can find qualified volunteers to assist in technology-related projects, such as website development, database management, and social media.
Conversely, volunteers can browse through available positions, access detailed information, and, if interested, get in touch with the NGO to offer their help.

## Key Features

### For NGOs:
- Registration and Authentication: NGOs can register and log in to the platform.
- Profile Management: NGOs can add profile details, including a profile picture.
- Positions Creation: NGOs can post job openings, specifying technological requirements.
- Positions Editing: Ability to edit job information if needed.
- Positions Deletion: Remove positions that have been filled or are no longer relevant (with the option to provide feedback to the platform).

### For Volunteers:

- Explore Positions: Volunteers can browse through available positions openings on the platform and search by technology or title.
- Positions Details: Detailed view of each position, including information about the NGO, position description, and NGO details.
- Contact NGOs: Volunteers can get in touch with ONGs through the platform, expressing their interest in helping out.
